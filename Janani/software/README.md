## 🧪 Technologies Used

| Category       | Stack                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Frontend       | HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript |
| Backend        | Flask (Python)                 |
| Charts         | Chart.js                       |

## Setup
1. Install Flask
2. Run `python app.py`
3. Open `http://localhost:5000/`
4. Once entered, click on the scan button, use the qr code placed in assets or generate a qr with the code QR001.
5. In the next page, use the code DR123. You will be directed to question forms. Here you will be asked some questions about the patient.
6. Finally the app will be opened. Since it is in early stage, there isn't much to see. But we can remodel it to our needs without much efforts. 
7. We have various sections inside like: Dashboard, Videos, Chat, Stress relievers, Settings, Contact etc.,
8. Our main priority in the end is to raise the interest in people to take pregnancy seriously and to take care from the beginning. BEcause prevention is always better than cure.
9. This app and kit might not be useful all the times. But it is already proved by the research that there is a need of such kit to prevent the following:

   - Over 50% of pregnant women in India don’t get full antenatal checkups
   - Many cases of high BP and gestational diabetes go undetected
   - Rural areas face delays in emergency care
   - A simple tracking system can reduce maternal risks by up to 35%

10. Our kit helps bridge this gap at the basic level.

##🔬 Based on Actual Research:

   - NFHS-5 Report (2021): Only 58.1% of pregnant women had at least 4 ANC visits.
   - Lancet Global Health (2020): Delayed diagnosis of gestational diabetes and hypertension is a major cause of maternal complications in India.
   - WHO Report: Regular BP, weight, and sugar monitoring can reduce maternal risk by 30–35% in low-resource settings.

In the end, we are only trying to give a chance to those who truly want to bring change. It’s up to them whether they follow it or not.
